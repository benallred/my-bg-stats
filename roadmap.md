# Roadmap

- Group related stat cards into visual sections (e.g., collection stats together, milestone stats together)
- Fix ownership status: Update code to use `statusOwned` field so "Total Games Owned" only counts currently owned games, while "Total Games Acquired" includes previously owned games
- Improve year filter dropdown: Include all acquisition years, even if no plays were logged, with separator between pre-logging and post-logging eras
- Add price-per-play statistics: cheapest game per play, most expensive game per play, average price-per-play
- Never Played stat should only include base games (exclude expansions and expandalones)
- Clicking an already-open card should close its details panel
- Fix expandalones count showing 0
- Update AGENTS.md to clarify "base game" terminology always excludes both expansions and expandalones
