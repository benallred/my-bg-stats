# Roadmap

*Note: Items are numbered for reference only. Order does not represent priority.*

1. Add price-per-play statistics: cheapest game per play, most expensive game per play, average price-per-play
2. Year in Review - Biggest Jumps: Games with most increased play count vs previous year
3. Year in Review - Game Statistics: Most played game by days, most played game by hours, longest single play (game + duration), most time-efficient game (most plays per hour), marathon game (highest total hours), unique games played, new-to-me games played, highest rated new-to-me game, oldest game played (by publication year), newest game played (by publication year)
4. Year in Review - Social & Locations: Total number of other players (excluding self), total solo plays, total solo days, total solo-only days (no multiplayer games that day), most common player count, most common day to play, game played with the most unique players, most social game (played with most unique players), biggest gaming session (most players in single session/day), locations played in, game played in the most locations, most frequented location, display list of players played with (implementation details TBD: anonymization, formatting, etc.)
5. Year in Review - Collection & Variety: Shelf of shame progress (games played for the first time, regardless of acquisition date), shelf of shame additions (games acquired this year still unplayed), resurrected games (not played previous year, played this year), dormant games (played previous year, not played this year), play concentration (% of plays from top 10 games), new vs familiar ratio (plays of new-to-me vs previously played)
6. Year in Review - Records & Comparisons: Personal records broken (all-time highs achieved this year), personal records set (all-time lows achieved this year), this year vs last year (plays, unique games, hours with % changes), speed gaming day (most games in shortest time), variety day (most unique games in one day), average play duration for the year, average rating of games played, weekend vs weekday play percentage
7. Add board game cover images throughout the app: Extract thumbnail URLs (`urlThumb`) and full-size URLs (`urlImage`) from BGStatsExport.json during data processing, store URLs in data.json (add `thumbnailUrl` and `coverUrl` fields to game objects), display thumbnails alongside game names throughout the app (stat cards, tables, breakdowns, year-in-review sections, diagnostics), implement lazy loading for performance (Intersection Observer API), add click-to-enlarge functionality showing full-size covers, include graceful fallback for missing/broken images, use progressive enhancement approach (text-first, images enhance the experience)
8. Add multi-column layout to Year in Review detail view: Display subsections in 2 columns when viewport is approximately 2x the width of the year-review-table element (roughly 1200px), falling back to single column on narrow screens. Use CSS Grid similar to existing patterns. Each subsection remains intact (no mid-subsection splits). Remove or adjust table max-width constraint to allow tables to fill their column width.
