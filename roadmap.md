# Roadmap

*Note: Items are numbered for reference only. Order does not represent priority.*

1. Add price-per-play statistics: cheapest game per play, most expensive game per play, average price-per-play
2. Add "Gaming Year in Review" section: New section positioned below stat cards and above diagnostics, using inline "description: number" format. Include:
   - **Engagement & Milestones:** New milestones reached for all base metric types (games hitting fives/dimes/quarters/centuries), games closest to next milestone for all base metric types, biggest jumps (games with most increased play count vs previous year)
   - **Time & Activity:** Total days played, total play time (hours), longest total playtime in one day, shortest total playtime in one day, busiest gaming month, longest play streak (consecutive days), longest dry spell (days between sessions), most productive gaming day
   - **Game Statistics:** Most played game by days, most played game by hours, longest single play (game + duration), most time-efficient game (most plays per hour), marathon game (highest total hours), unique games played, new-to-me games played, highest rated new-to-me game, oldest game played (by publication year), newest game played (by publication year)
   - **Social & Locations:** Total number of other players (excluding self), total solo plays, total solo days, total solo-only days (no multiplayer games that day), most common player count, most common day to play, game played with the most unique players, most social game (played with most unique players), biggest gaming session (most players in single session/day), locations played in, game played in the most locations, most frequented location
   - **Collection & Variety:** Shelf of shame progress (games played for the first time, regardless of acquisition date), shelf of shame additions (games acquired this year still unplayed), resurrected games (not played previous year, played this year), dormant games (played previous year, not played this year), play concentration (% of plays from top 10 games), new vs familiar ratio (plays of new-to-me vs previously played)
   - **Records & Comparisons:** Personal records broken (all-time highs achieved this year), personal records set (all-time lows achieved this year), this year vs last year (plays, unique games, hours with % changes), speed gaming day (most games in shortest time), variety day (most unique games in one day), average play duration for the year, average rating of games played, weekend vs weekday play percentage
   - When viewing current year, show stats through latest logged play date only (no projections)
3. Improve copy display names: When only one copy is shown in a list, don't show "(Copy X)". When multiple copies of the same game are shown, use versionName from BGStatsExport in parentheses. If versionName is missing, use placeholder "no version set".
4. Add info icon to h-index card: Display clickable info icon on h-index stat card. On click, show modal with h-index concept definition and concrete example (explaining the aggregation method regardless of which base metric is selected). Modal dismisses when tapped/clicked outside.
5. Add session length substats to Total Days Played card: Show median and average play duration per gaming day. Calculate by grouping plays by date, summing durationMin for each day (exclude days with sum of 0), then computing median and average of those daily totals. Display as "Median: X.X hours/day" and "Average: X.X hours/day" substats. Year-filterable. Only includes days with gaming sessions (not all calendar days).
6. Add cumulative substats to milestone cards: Each milestone card (Fives, Dimes, Quarters, Centuries) should display a substat showing the total count of games that have reached that threshold or higher. Display format: 'All games with X+ [metric]: N' where X is the threshold (5, 10, 25, 100) and [metric] changes based on the selected base metric filter (plays/sessions/hours). For example, Fives card shows count of all games with 5+, Dimes shows 10+, Quarters shows 25+, Centuries shows 100+.
