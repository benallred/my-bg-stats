## Board Game Statistics Terminology

### Base Game Definition

In board game statistics contexts, "base game" refers exclusively to standalone games that are neither expansions nor expandalones:

- **Base game**: A standalone game that is not an expansion and not an expandalone
- **Expansion**: Content that requires another game to play
- **Expandalone**: Standalone game that can be played independently but also functions as an expansion to another game

These categories are mutually exclusive. A game classified as an expandalone is NOT a base game, even though it can be played standalone.
