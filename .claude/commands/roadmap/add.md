description: Add a new item to the roadmap
---

You are helping the user add a new item to the roadmap.

**New idea from user:** $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Read the current roadmap:** Read @roadmap.md to understand existing items

2. **Clarify the idea:** Work with the user to formulate the idea clearly and completely. Ask questions to understand:
   - What specifically should be implemented
   - Any technical details or constraints
   - Expected behavior or outcomes

3. **Check for similar items:** Review the roadmap for similar or related items. If found:
   - Present them to the user
   - Discuss whether this is a duplicate, should be combined, or is truly distinct
   - If combining, help merge the ideas appropriately

4. **Identify prerequisites:** Analyze the roadmap to determine if:
   - Any existing items should be completed first
   - Completing other items first would make this easier/better
   - Present your findings and discuss with the user

5. **Add to roadmap:** Once finalized:
   - Add the new item to the end of the numbered list
   - Use the next sequential number
   - Format consistently with existing items
   - Update roadmap.md

Remember: The goal is to ensure new items are well-defined, non-duplicate, and properly sequenced.
